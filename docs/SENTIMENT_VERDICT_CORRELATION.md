# Sentiment-Verdict Correlation Pattern Matching

## Overview
This feature validates whether the emotional signature of content matches the expected patterns for its fact-check verdict, providing users with an additional layer of verification and helping them understand content authenticity.

## How It Works

### Pattern-Based Analysis
The system compares the sentiment characteristics of content against established patterns for each verdict type:

#### False Claims Pattern:
- **Emotional Intensity**: 65-100% (Very High)
- **Dominant Sentiment**: Negative or Mixed
- **Negative Score**: ≥50%
- **Manipulation Tactics**: 2+ detected
- **Target Emotions**: Fear, Anger, Outrage
- **Red Flags**: 2+ linguistic markers

#### Verified Content Pattern:
- **Emotional Intensity**: 0-50% (Low)
- **Dominant Sentiment**: Neutral
- **Neutral Score**: ≥45%
- **Manipulation Tactics**: ≤1
- **Target Emotions**: None
- **Red Flags**: Minimal

#### Misleading Content Pattern:
- **Emotional Intensity**: 50-85% (Moderate-High)
- **Dominant Sentiment**: Mixed or Negative
- **Mixed Score**: ≥30%
- **Manipulation Tactics**: 1+ detected
- **Target Emotions**: Confusion, Urgency, Fear

### Pattern Matching Confidence
The system calculates a match percentage (0-100%) based on:
1. Emotional intensity range
2. Dominant sentiment type
3. Specific sentiment scores
4. Number of manipulation tactics
5. Target emotions alignment
6. Linguistic red flags count

## User Benefits

### 1. **Second Opinion Validation** ✅
Users get independent confirmation that the verdict makes sense:
- "✅ 92% Pattern Match - Sentiment confirms false verdict"
- "🚨 35% Pattern Match - Sentiment inconsistent with verified verdict"

### 2. **Educational Insight** 📚
Users learn what emotional patterns indicate:
- False claims use fear + high emotion
- Verified content stays neutral
- Misleading content mixes truth with emotion

### 3. **Increased Trust** 🛡️
When sentiment matches the verdict:
- Increases confidence in the analysis
- Validates the AI's classification
- Provides research-backed explanation

### 4. **Red Flags for Inconsistencies** 🚩
When sentiment doesn't match:
- Prompts users to look deeper
- May indicate an outlier case
- Suggests verdict reconsideration needed
