/**
 * Analyzes verification status and confidence using LLM with comprehensive fact-check analysis.
 *
 * This function takes a claim and supporting research content, then uses AI to determine:
 * - Verification status (verified/misleading/unverifiable)
 * - Confidence level (0.0 to 1.0)
 *
 * **Important**: The analysis prioritizes PRIMARY claims over SECONDARY details. Content
 * is marked as "verified" if the core factual assertion is true, even if embellishments
 * or superlatives (e.g., "first ever", "only one") are inaccurate. This ensures the
 * fact-check focuses on the substantive claim rather than getting sidetracked by minor
 * exaggerations.
 *
 * The function includes intelligent fallbacks for when API keys are unavailable,
 * using keyword-based analysis as a backup method.
 *
 * @param claim - The original claim or content to be verified
 * @param searchContent - Research content and evidence from credible sources
 * @returns Promise resolving to verification status and confidence score
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await analyzeVerificationStatus(
 *   "Australia provides free education and is the first country ever to do so",
 *   "Research shows Australia does provide free education, but other countries did it first..."
 * );
 *
 * console.log(result.status); // "verified" (core claim is true)
 * console.log(result.confidence); // 0.85
 * ```

Research Results:
${searchContent}

Based on the research evidence, determine:
1. Verification Status: Choose ONE of: "verified", "partially_true", "misleading", "false", "exaggerated", "outdated", "opinion", "rumor", "conspiracy", "debunked", "satire", "unverifiable"
2. Confidence Level: A number from 0.0 to 1.0 representing how confident you are in this assessment

Guidelines:
- "verified": The PRIMARY/CORE claim is accurate and supported by evidence
  * Use this even if minor secondary details (like superlatives "first ever", "only one") are inaccurate
  * Focus on whether the main factual assertion is true
  * Example: "Australia offers free education" (verified) vs "first country to do so" (secondary detail)

- "partially_true": The claim contains both accurate and inaccurate elements
  * Use when some facts are correct but others are wrong or misleading
  * Example: "The vaccine causes autism" (partially true - vaccine exists, but autism claim is false)
  
- "misleading": The PRIMARY claim itself is substantially false, lacks critical context, or is deceptive
  * Use this when the core fact is wrong or presented in a way that creates false impressions
  * Do NOT use this just because embellishments or secondary details are inaccurate

- "false": The claim is demonstrably incorrect based on credible evidence
  * Use for clearly debunked claims with strong evidence against them
  * Example: "COVID-19 was created in a lab" (false - natural origin confirmed by scientists)

- "exaggerated": The claim contains truth but is overstated or sensationalized
  * Use when facts are stretched beyond what evidence supports
  * Example: "Millions died from vaccines" (exaggerated - some deaths occurred but not millions)

- "outdated": The claim was true at one time but is no longer accurate
  * Use for information that has been superseded by newer evidence
  * Example: "The Earth is flat" (outdated - disproven centuries ago)

- "opinion": The content expresses subjective views rather than factual claims
  * Use for personal beliefs, preferences, or subjective statements
  * Example: "This movie is terrible" (opinion - not a factual claim)

- "rumor": Unverified information circulating without credible sources
  * Use for unsubstantiated claims that lack reliable evidence
  * Example: "Celebrity X is getting divorced" (rumor - no confirmed sources)

- "conspiracy": Claims involving secret plots or hidden agendas without evidence
  * Use for theories about secretive groups controlling events
  * Example: "The government is hiding aliens" (conspiracy - no credible evidence)

- "debunked": Claims that have been thoroughly disproven by multiple sources
  * Use for claims with strong evidence against them from credible sources
  * Example: "Vaccines cause autism" (debunked - multiple studies disprove this)

- "satire": Content intended as humor or parody, not factual information
  * Use for comedic content that might be mistaken for real news
  * Example: "Man bites dog" from satirical news site (satire)
  
- "unverifiable": Insufficient credible evidence to make a determination about the primary claim

**IMPORTANT**: Base your verdict on the PRIMARY claim, not embellishments or secondary details.
