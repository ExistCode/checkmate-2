# Political Bias Meter - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Feature Completed

A comprehensive Political Bias Meter feature has been successfully implemented for Malaysia-related political content analysis.

### üîß Latest Update (JSON Parsing Fix)
- **Fixed**: Robust JSON extraction to handle malformed AI responses
- **Handles**: Markdown code blocks, extra text, unterminated strings
- **Fallback**: Gracefully falls back to keyword-based analysis on parse errors
- **Logging**: Added debug logs to track AI response issues

## üéØ Core Requirements Met

### 1. ‚úÖ Trigger Conditions
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **keyword matching** implemented
- Detects Malaysia political context using comprehensive keyword lists:
  - **Government keywords**: parliament, prime minister, cabinet, GE16, election, budget, ministry, government, policy, subsidy, manifesto
  - **Political parties**: 
    - Government: Pakatan Harapan (PH), Barisan Nasional (BN), DAP, PKR, Amanah, UMNO, MIC, MCA
    - Opposition: Perikatan Nasional (PN), Bersatu, PAS, Gerakan
  - **Political figures**: Anwar Ibrahim, Zahid Hamidi, Anthony Loke, Lim Guan Eng, Muhyiddin Yassin, Hadi Awang, Hamzah Zainudin, Najib Razak, and more

- **Smart detection logic**:
  - Activates if Malaysia context + 2+ political indicators
  - OR 3+ strong political indicators (party names/figures) even without explicit Malaysia mention

### 2. ‚úÖ Analysis Logic
- **AI-powered sentiment and framing analysis** using AWS Bedrock
- **0-100 bias score** with clear categories:
  - **0-30**: Opposition-leaning (critical of government, praises opposition)
  - **31-69**: Neutral/Mixed (balanced tone, no clear alignment)
  - **70-100**: Pro-Government (praises government, critical of opposition)

- **Score is calculated internally** but NOT shown to users
- **Fallback to keyword-based analysis** when AI is unavailable

### 3. ‚úÖ Frontend Output (UI)
- **Conditional rendering**: Only displays for Malaysia political content
- **Horizontal awareness meter** with:
  - Beautiful gradient visualization (blue ‚Üí gray ‚Üí green)
  - Position indicator dot reflecting the internal score
  - Clear category labels without revealing exact score
  - 2-3 line explanation of framing patterns
  - **Key quote** display showing influential phrases
  - Confidence indicator for low-confidence assessments
  - Disclaimer: "This meter identifies framing patterns in political content. It does not determine factual accuracy."

### 4. ‚úÖ Fallback Behavior
- **No rendering** if content is not political or not Malaysia-related
- Graceful degradation to keyword-based analysis when AI unavailable
- Clear confidence warnings for uncertain assessments

## üß™ Test Example

**URL**: `https://x.com/theedgemalaysia/status/1974373897119412457`

**Expected Content**: 
> "PM Anwar Ibrahim's budget has been hailed as a transformative step for the rakyat, despite criticism from PN leaders who called it fiscally irresponsible."

**Expected Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ **Detected as Malaysia Political**: Yes
- ‚úÖ **Bias Score**: 75-80 (Pro-Government range)
- ‚úÖ **Display**: Dot positioned toward Pro-Government side
- ‚úÖ **Explanation**: "The article consistently praises government initiatives while portraying the opposition as obstructive. Uses positive framing ('hailed', 'transformative') for government actions and negative framing ('criticism', 'irresponsible') for opposition."
- ‚úÖ **Key Quote**: "budget has been hailed as a transformative step"

---

## üîç How It Works

### Detection Flow
```
1. Content ‚Üí Extract text
2. Run keyword matching on lowercase text
3. Check for Malaysia context keywords
4. Count political indicators (government, parties, figures)
5. Determine if Malaysia political (context + indicators)
6. If YES ‚Üí Proceed to bias analysis
7. If NO ‚Üí Skip bias analysis, no meter shown
```

### Analysis Flow (when triggered)
```
1. Prepare AI prompt with Malaysia political context
2. Call AWS Bedrock with content analysis request
3. AI returns:
   - Bias score (0-100)
   - Explanation (2-3 lines)
   - Key quote
   - Bias indicators
   - Confidence level
4. Map score to visual position on meter
5. Render PoliticalBiasMeter component
```

### Display Logic
```
If (factCheck.politicalBias?.isMalaysiaPolitical === true 
    AND factCheck.politicalBias?.malaysiaBiasScore !== undefined) {
  ‚Üí Show PoliticalBiasMeter component
} else {
  ‚Üí Hide meter (content not Malaysia political)
}
```

- **Professional disclaimers**: Clear about what the meter does and doesn't measure
- **Dark mode support**: Fully responsive to theme changes
- **Accessibility**: Clear labels, semantic HTML, proper contrast ratios
